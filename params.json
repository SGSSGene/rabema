The methodology is based on a strict definition of the read mapping problem and allows the evaluation of arbitrary read mapping programs that create SAM output.\r\nThe paper gives an explanation of the theory behind the benchmark methodology with an example evaluation.\r\n\r\n### More Information\r\n\r\nSee [the project's Github project](https://github.com/seqan/rabema) for a manual and more information.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\n- For questions, create an issue in the issue tracker of this project.\r\n",
